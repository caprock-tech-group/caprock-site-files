## The New Rules: Texas Safe Harbor Law (SB 2610)

In 2025, Texas rolled out the Safe Harbor Law (SB 2610), giving small and midsize businesses a rare opportunity: real legal protection against lawsuits after a data breach—if you can prove you’ve built and maintained a solid cybersecurity program. To qualify, your business (with fewer than 250 employees) must align your cybersecurity practices with recognized frameworks like NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) or HITRUST.

This changes the game. Instead of seeing cybersecurity as a cost center, it’s now a strategic investment that can literally save your company in court.

## Security Is More Than a Firewall

Firewalls are still important; they act as gatekeepers, blocking unwanted internet traffic. But today’s threats go way beyond what a firewall alone can handle. Cyber attackers target individuals with phishing emails, exploit unpatched software, and use ransomware—malicious software that locks up your data until you pay a ransom.

Texas businesses need a layered defense, built on proven frameworks and common-sense practices.

## Essential Steps for a Secure SMB

### Assess Your Risks First

Every business is unique. Before picking solutions, identify what data or processes you need to protect most—like financial records, customer information, or operational systems. A strategic risk assessment will show where you’re most vulnerable so you can focus your security efforts where they matter.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Don’t trust passwords alone. MFA requires employees to use a second form of identity verification (like a text code) before logging in. This single step stops the vast majority of brute-force attacks and is now considered a base-level best practice.

- Enable MFA on all business accounts
- Prioritize email, cloud storage, and any financial applications

### Modern Endpoint Protection

Antivirus isn’t enough if it isn’t kept current. Today’s solutions monitor for suspicious behavior, not just known viruses. Use tools that provide real-time threat detection and automatic updates for all company devices—laptops, phones, and desktops alike.

- Install software that can detect and quarantine threats automatically
- Regularly update all systems, not just computers

### Data Encryption—In Transit and At Rest

Encryption scrambles your data so only authorized users can make sense of it. Use it for sensitive files on your servers, laptops, and mobile devices, as well as for data sent over email or remote connections. If a laptop goes missing, encrypted data is almost impossible for a thief to use.

### Regular Backups

Ransomware attacks are rampant—and paying a cybercriminal isn’t just risky, it’s often illegal. Save your business by setting up automatic backups, preferably with a cloud-based solution. Test restoring those backups so you know they’ll work when you need them.

- Back up daily or hourly, if possible
- Store backups offsite or in the cloud

## Your People Are the Front Line

Cybersecurity isn’t only about technology; it’s about culture and training. Most breaches start because someone made a simple mistake—clicked the wrong link, shared a password, or lost a phone on a job site.

### Employee Training

- Run quarterly security awareness training so teams can spot phishing, social engineering scams, and suspicious websites
- Set up clear reporting channels for anything odd—no blame, just fast action

### Mobile Device Security

Work happens everywhere. Make sure all company devices—phones and tablets included—have password protection and encryption, and can be wiped remotely if lost. Create simple policies, and make sure everyone knows what to do if a device goes missing.

## Planning for When (Not If) Something Goes Wrong

No security program is perfect. Prepare for incidents ahead of time to minimize damage.

### Incident Response Plan

- Draft a clear, step-by-step plan for what to do if you suspect a breach
- Include who to call (IT partner, legal, law enforcement), how to contain threats, and how to notify customers if needed
- Test your plan yearly through tabletop exercises so everyone knows their role

### Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

Automate what you can. Use monitoring tools that alert you to suspicious activity across your systems and review those alerts regularly. Schedule periodic security reviews—threats change quickly, and what worked last year might not be enough now.

## Leadership, Compliance, and Customer Trust

Cybersecurity is no longer just “an IT thing.” Business owners, managers, and employees all play a crucial role. Frameworks like NIST and HITRUST bring structure to your program and provide “safe harbor” under the new Texas law. They also offer reassurance for clients and partners that your business is taking data protection seriously.

Pursuing certifications like HITRUST—while an investment—demonstrates to customers, insurers, and the courts that your SMB isn’t cutting corners. In fact, organizations with HITRUST certification reported 99% fewer breaches in 2024.
